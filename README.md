### 🧬 About Me

Hi, I'm **Furkan Adıgüzel**!  
I love building software that’s **simple, practical, and easy to use**. I enjoy working on both **frontend and backend projects**, creating tools and apps that make life easier for users and teams.  

I’ve worked on **small web apps, backend services, and data handling projects**.  
These experiences helped me **learn clean code**, **solve problems step by step**, and **collaborate effectively** with others.  

I’m always exploring **new technologies**, experimenting with ideas, and improving my skills every day.  
I like projects where I can be involved in **both design and implementation**, making sure the final product is **reliable, user-friendly, and works well**.
