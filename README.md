👋 Hi there!

🧬 About Me

Hi, I'm Furkan Adıgüzel. I enjoy building software that is simple, useful, and easy to maintain. I like working on both the frontend and backend, creating applications and tools that help people and teams work better.  

I have worked on small projects with web apps, backend services, and data handling. These projects helped me learn the basics of writing clean code, solving problems, and working with a team.

I enjoy learning new technologies, experimenting with new ideas, and improving my skills every day. I like projects where I can contribute to both the design and the implementation, making sure the final result is reliable, easy to use, and effective.
